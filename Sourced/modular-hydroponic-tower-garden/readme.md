# Recommended parts

* Water pump:
* 10 mm outlet: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000422969945.html
* 19 mm outlet (tube adapter needed): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32804709012.html
* ID=10 mm / OD=13 mm silicone tube for the internal dispenser module:

* ID=18 mm / OD=24 mm silicone tube for the water pump adapter if 19 mm water pump is used:

* I'm using a 20L variant but anywhere over this volume works. 30L has seemingly large enough screw cap to fit and glue the module adapter into it. 20L is a borderline case.

# Watering schedule

Last year I started with 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off.

My current schedule is 5 minutes on and 20 minutes off.

You can further shorten the on-time and lengthen the off-time if power saving is a requirement. Let the roots of the plants be completely wet (should take a few minutes at least) and start the water pump again when they start to dry out (up to 1 hour).

If you don't have a timer then continuous water circulation is also a possibility.

Unfortunately this fertilizer doesn't work with hydroponic systems.
